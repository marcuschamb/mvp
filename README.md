# Barebone Ionic
This project is a generic Ionic application with ingredients that can be part of every modern Ionic application.

## Run the app
Use `ionic serve` to run the app for a browser preview

or

use `ionic serve --lab` to run the app in a browser on two platforms at the same time.

### Add hooks
```bash
$ ionic hooks add
```

### Install plugins using package.json
The required plugins should be installed before any platform addition and build. This could be done by calling the `ionic state restore` command.

### Add a platform

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
```

Supported Cordova platforms:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic platform add android
```

### Build the app

```bash
$ ionic build ios
```

### Î•mulate the app on simulator
iOS:

```bash
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Android:

```bash
$ ionic emulate android
```

```

eg:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
```
